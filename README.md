# Simple RPG game for Windows
A simple RPG game made using VS2019 and VB.NET, runs on windows with VB.NET 4.7.2 or higher

This is one of my first **B E E G** projects. It will feature:

 - A basic battle system
 - Auto walking arround
 - With that one, a counter of how many game ticks are left for getting to the boss
 - A simple saving method

I hope you enjoy :)
